Aggregation pipelines are a framework for data transformation and processing, these help us in getting insights from the data, being non destructive and flexible

Aggregation pipelines consist of multiple independant stages of processing 

you can process the data one by one stage wise and it will provide the data in whatever condition, whatever format and whatever amount we want 


Model.aggregate(
    [
        {
            //stage 1
        },
        {
            //stage 2
        },
        {
            stage 3
        }
    ]
)

STAGES 


1. $match -> filters the documents based on specified conditions, similar to find() method 

2. $group -> used to group the data based on specified fields and performs calculations
