what is node js

this is a js runtime that executes code for efficient and scalable implementation
of backend projects in mern stack

why do we need node js?

in order to make sure that our servers are live 24 by 7, we need a good js runtime 
that is event driven (this is improve the efficiency) and should be non blocking (if one task is running, it shouldnt be disturbed to execute another task) and that is provideed by nodejs

NODE.JS
Creating a node js application


1-> terminal -> npm init = initialises node package manager in the folder



Entry point / endpoint => whenever we take our project live-> it will execute this file 


2-> npm run start -> this command executes a script called start



EXPRESS.js -> Minimal and lightweight framework for building server side applications
0. npm i express
1.import and set up the express instance (app)
2. port listener -> req 

3. standard syntax 
app.listen(PORT, handlerFunction)
 
 app = express app instance
 listen -> method 
 handlerFunction -> handles the action related to the method 



app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

app -> express application
METHOD -> is the HTTP method that we are using which fetching data from api 

methods-> get, post, put, patch, delete 

PATH -> this is location of that feature in the server 
www.acciojob-backend.com

HANDLER -> because it handles the event when the request is recieved on the server 


//signup -> www.acciojob-backend.com/signup


app.get("/helloworld", (req, res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World")
} )


req, res -> these are the request and responsce objects that are recieved on the backend and sent to any front end 

whatever inofrmation is send through my api -> it will be sent to the owner of the project 

req and res are two values, that are provided to us by nodejs that we use to send or recieve the sent data 

handler function simply handles the routes whenever they recieve a request on it 



NODEMON -> package that will restart my server whenever i make any change in it
