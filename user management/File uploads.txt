Multer

Node.js Middleware specifically developed for multipart data or form data 

Example -> instagram post functionality -> form -> content or media, caption, tagged people, comment -> multipart/form-data -> file data -> encoding -> that is why it needs to be treated specially -> file upload -> Multer 


-> Middleware based functionality 
-> Multipart data only 
-> Request object manipulation -> file -> req.files 
-> Flexible storage options -> local storage, memory and custom engines (AI)


Multipart Data -> form url enocded -> key:value -> binary format 

Multer benefits -> req.body, req.files, req.file
